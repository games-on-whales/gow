# Documentation

This is a Jekyll themed documentation that you can see at https://games-on-whales.github.io/gow/

Markdown pages are accessible under [collections](collections/).

We use [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) for theming with a different dark theme that you can see at [_sass/color_schemes/gow-dark.scss](_sass/color_schemes/gow-dark.scss)

In order to build it locally use [Bundler](https://bundler.io/):

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```
