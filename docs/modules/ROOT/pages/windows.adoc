== Windows

On Windows your best bet is to just install the application like you’ll
normally do without using Docker.

It should be possible to run GOW on Windows but there are a few issues
that we still haven’t figured out:

* WSL2 is missing the uinput kernel module
** We have built it from scratch by compiling the kernel, but even then,
Xorg still fails to start
