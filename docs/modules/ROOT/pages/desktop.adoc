== Desktop environments

Generally, instead of running `Xorg` and `PulseAudio` from inside
Docker, you can use your current desktop and audio system and just pass
the required sockets in order for GUI containers to use your desktop and
audio.

There are still some benefits of _containerizing_ GUI applications and
run them over Docker:

* It’s easy to control how much CPU and Memory to allocate to each app that runs via Docker
* You don’t have to manage installation scripts, dependencies conflicts, and updates
** we’ll do that for you
* You can easily delete all files created by the application by removing the docker container
* It’s easier to backup configuration files and state
