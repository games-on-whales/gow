=== Nvidia GPUs with proprietary drivers

You can see if your host is using the proprietary driver using `lshw`:

[source,bash]
....
$ lshw -class video | grep -i driver
       configuration: driver=nvidia latency=0
....

In order to make use of your GPU inside a docker container, you’ll need
to set up the https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker[NVIDIA Container
Toolkit].

If you have more than one nvidia GPU, you may want to set the `GPU_UUID`
variable in `env/nvidia.env` to indicate which card to use.

To get the correct UUID for your GPU, use the `nvidia-container-cli`
command:

[source,bash]
....
$ sudo nvidia-container-cli --load-kmods info
NVRM version:   [version]
CUDA version:   11.3

Device Index:   0
Device Minor:   0
Model:          NVIDIA GeForce [model]
Brand:          GeForce
GPU UUID:       GPU-[uuid]
Bus Location:   00000000:0a:00.0
Architecture:   7.5
....

IMPORTANT: You will also need to pass the `--gpu nvidia` flag any time you run
a `run-gow` command.

=== Nvidia GPUs with `nouveau` drivers

It should be possible to use the `nouveau` driver, but be aware that this path is significantly less well-tested than using the proprietary driver.

Make sure that the host doesn’t use proprietary drivers but that it’s
using the open source `nouveau` drivers.

[source,bash]
....
sudo lshw -class video | grep driver=
       configuration: driver=nouveau latency=0
....

Double check that the GPU card is correctly listed under `/dev/dri/`:

[source,bash]
....
ls -la /dev/dri/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root        100 Jun 20 09:47 .
drwxr-xr-x 17 root root       3100 Jun 20 10:33 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root         80 Jun 20 09:47 by-path
crw-rw----  1 root video  226,   0 Jun 20 09:47 card0
crw-rw----  1 root render 226, 128 Jun 20 09:47 renderD128
....

IMPORTANT: Because the `nouveau` driver implements standard APIs, you will _not_ need to pass `--gpu nvidia` when using `run-gow`.
