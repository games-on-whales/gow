![Lutris Gamepad UI screenshot](assets/screenshot.png)

An open-source. simple, TV-friendly, gamepad-navigable frontend for the Lutris game launcher on Linux. This application provides a "10-foot UI" designed for couch gaming, allowing you to browse and launch your Lutris library entirely with a gamepad.

# Directory Setup
TLDR: Mount your lutris config and game directories to replace lutris native config. Paths are same as WolfLutris. Check the relevant directories at [startup-10-create-dirs.sh](build/scripts/startup-10-create-dirs.sh)

Proper documentation is coming soon (I would appreciate any help through PR)...
